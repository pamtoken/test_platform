## ISSUES

For now, our issues will be created and placed into this empty repo.  

Our plans are to allow our community to vote on which projects we reward with PAM Tokens.

Then we will create a platform where anybody can submit issues for their own projects.

There is still a lot of work for us to do before we get there, but we are focused on creating a secure platform.

And since we are new to smart contract programming, we're looking for some blockchain experts to help us create that system.

We simply want to make sure everything is secure and works perfect. So if you know your way around the blockchain, please let us know.
